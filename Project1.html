    <h1>Dungeon Master Thediem</h1>
      <p>I've always been a fantastic story teller and with the support of my friends & family, I've been graced with the opportunity to run 4+ separate campaigns over the last 6 years! Below you'll find the headlining title
      of the OG story that catapulted my success with the additional campaigns</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 3 Kings</li>
    </ul>
      <p>An unlikely alliance between the Queen Midnight locked away in her frozen home, a group of traveling mercenaries begin a war, and a dominance over the country unseen by any nations before. King Red Iron with steel
      resolve tries to recover his wayward son he believes is held captive within the enemies stronghold. One of which is believed to be a space conjured by magic into the material plane. Little did they know that all
      invovled would kiss deaths lips sooner than they expected</p>
